## Program in question?

The program has the didactic purpose of learning how to work with components in Angular CLI. To accomplish this, three components were created, each with the function of consuming an API. To do this, a "service" folder was created with two methods: "apiGetpomon" and "apiListAllpomons", which are responsible for making the API requests (using https://pokeapi.co/).

# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version  15.1.2 and Node: 18.13.0


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project's goal

The project aims to practice the Angular knowledge acquired during the Udemy course.
Project developed in the Udemy course "Angular 2 (v15+) Typescript from Basics to Advanced" by Professor Dener Troquatte.

## The course exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it. Here's the link:
